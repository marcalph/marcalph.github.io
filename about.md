Hi, I'm Marc and this is my tech blog. As is I want this to be a portfolio for my side-projects and will also use it to rant about machine learning stuff.

I'm a french data scientist with a sweet tooth for Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. I'm a firm believer in technology, so I look forward to the time when machines will be able to think and feel. Will code for coffee/pizza.
